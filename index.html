        'Junk food' is essentially any food that is highly processed, high in
        calories and low in nutrients. Junk food is also usually high in added
        sugars, salt and saturated or trans fats. Some evidence points to junk
        foods as being as addictive as alcohol and drugs.

        In the words of celebrity nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar, "jitna packet
        khulta hai, utna pet foolta hai". She claims that under the garb of
        selling products as ‘healthy’ based on one ingredient, we consumers tend
        to ignore all other ingredients that make the product unfit to consume.

        As a part of her RD Fitness Project 2019, she revealed many hidden junk
        foods or junk foods camouflaged as health foods that you and your kids
        are eating every day. A classic example is the current trend of
        switching to fibre and digestive biscuits with a thought that they are
        healthier counterparts. These biscuits promise to be made of healthy
        ingredients like oats, ragi, whole wheat flour etc. But the truth is

        ingredients to make them tasty that the point is completely lost. In

        Aside from unethical marketing, online food delivery platforms have also

        As per the National Family Health Survey – 4 (NFHS-4)- 4% of all adults
        in India between the ages of 15-49 are obese and 20% are overweight. As
        for children, 1.25% are obese and 3.75% are overweight. Over 25% of the

        The healthcare industry does not financially benefit from treating
        obesity through nutritional advice. In fact, they make significantly
        more through the lifestyle diseases that plague those with long-term
        obesity. If we are truly interested in reducing the prevalence of
        lifestyle diseases in our population, we will need to find ways to
        motivate people away from junk foods that cause obesity and associated
        diseases.

        With the increased momentum in the direction of ‘Fit India Movement’
        that is focused on making 1.3 crore Indians fit and healthy, we believe
        that the government should to take additional steps for eradication of
        obesity among Indians in the below mentioned ways-
      </div>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li class="extramargin paragraph">
          Imposition of heavy taxes on junk food to discourage unhealthy eating
          habits. Kerala Govt imposed junk food tax in 2016. 79% of people are
          in favour of a “sin tax” on foods high in fat, sugar and salt found an
          online survey conducted by Local Circles in 2017.
        </li>

        <li class="paragraph">
          Introduce a blanket ban on HFSS food advertising. There should be a
          ban on advertisements for junk food on television, especially kids’
          channels. Walt Disney has already taken a lead and stopped
          advertisements on junk food on their channels as a part of
          self-regulation. 88% want junk-food advertising banned on children’s
          channels on television, found an online survey.
        </li>

        <li class="extramargin paragraph">
          The Government should promote healthy eating and propagate no food
          wastage in schools.

      </ul>

      <ul class="numbers">
        <li class="extramargin paragraph">
          Misleading food labels should be looked into and the clear marking of
          Sugar, Saturated Fats and other unhealthy ingredients should be

          In a major development, the Delhi High Court has ruled in Uday
          Foundation for Congenital Defect and rare Blood Groups vs. Union of
          India that junk food – high in fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) – must be
          restricted in schools and a 50-meter radius. Guidelines for the same
          have been framed by the Central Advisory Committee formed under the
          Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="paragraph">
          Another regulatory facet is Food Labeling. It serves as a primary link
          of communication between the manufacturer and packer of food on the
          one hand and distributor, seller, and user or consumer on the other
          hand. As per FSS (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2020; the
          consumers will now also know the content of salt and other nutrients
          in each serve as the serving size would be provided on the package.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="paragraph">
          Declaration of added sugar has also been made mandatory. This will
          help consumers understand the nature and quantity of sugar in the
          product and they can differentiate between added and natural sugars.
          These are all steps in the right direction.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          In the era of cut-throat competition, an advertisement is a major tool
          through which brands create a consumer niche for themselves. However,
          in doing so, they often resort to practices like puffery, deception
          which leads to a misleading advertisement by the manufactures of food
          and health products. These malpractices call for urgent regulatory
          intervention.

          Junk food is not alone present in the Indian market but also in the
          Indian kitchen. For India, it’s a matter of grave concern as India is
          the diabetic capital of the world and Indian traditional food is free
          from all health hazards but has failed to catch up in terms of
          presence in the Indian mindset
